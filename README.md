# NFT Compression Examples

This repository provides examples on how to mint and interact with compressed NFTs. 
The examples are based Metaplex's [examples](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/compression-read-api-js-examples) but are updated to be compatible with the latest API spec and Helius RPCs.
